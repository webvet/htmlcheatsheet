# CSS Cheatsheet

This is a short project from Codecademy to produce a simple, sinlge-page website to explain an element of CSS from the course. 

I have chosen to put together a brief explaination of CSS, what it can be used for and how to use it. Part of the exercise was to include an HTML table, which is used to help demonstrate the three methods that can be used to include CSS into a web page - inline, embedded and external.

Other parts of this task include:

Custom styling of HTML tags (such as h1 etc)
Importing font styles
Representing code with a monospace font & different background colour

I also chose to experiment and use a pseudo-class to style the first letter of each new paragraph.
